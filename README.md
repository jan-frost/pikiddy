Enabling and disabling the splash screen is with some extra arguments in /boot/cmdline.txt – if this line includes “quiet splash”, the splash screen is shown; if it does not include those words, the old text-based boot is shown.

The splash screen is a PNG file at /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png – you can change the image to whatever you want as long as you use the same file name.
